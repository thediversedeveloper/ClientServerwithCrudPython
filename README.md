I first go back within the code and look at any easily identifiable mistakes, and test the code as soon as I write a class so I am not going back over hundreds of lines. I also, go back in the resources, and view videos. It helps to know your learning style, and also when to stop and come back to an issue. 
#I had a lot of problems throughout this course, and I will be taking what I learned about databases and following suit to learn SQL, and other database mnanagement systems. I will also apply these concepts when developing apps.
